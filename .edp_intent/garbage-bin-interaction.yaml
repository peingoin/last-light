originalIntent: "I want to set up an interaction system so that when I press the E key while looking at the garbage bin in my game, it triggers an interaction event. The garbage bin should be a recognized interactable object, and pressing E should allow the player to interact with it to collect 6-10 total resources (wood + steel combined). The system should be extensible for other interactable objects in the future."
