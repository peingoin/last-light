acceptanceCriteria:

    description: "Camera displays correct 4x zoom view of player"
    given: "Game scene is loaded"
    when: "Player is positioned in scene"
    then: "Camera shows 4x zoomed view centered on player"
  - id: "AC-002"
    description: "Camera follows player movement smoothly"
    given: "Player moves around the scene"
    when: "Player position changes"
    then: "Camera smoothly follows player with position smoothing"

    description: "YSort depth sorting continues to work"
    given: "Player and objects are in scene"
    when: "Player moves relative to objects"
    then: "Depth sorting works - player renders behind/in front based on Y position"
  - id: "AC-004"
    description: "No hierarchy conflicts between camera and YSort"
    given: "Camera and YSort systems are both active"
    when: "Both systems operate simultaneously"
    then: "No transform interference or positioning conflicts occur"
nonGoals:
  - "Changing camera settings (zoom, smoothing speed)"
  - "Modifying player movement or collision systems"
  - "Optimizing YSort performance"
  - "Adding new camera features or functionality"
