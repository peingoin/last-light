acceptanceCriteria:
  - id: "AC-001"
    description: "Objects are depth-sorted by Y position"
    given: "Multiple objects spawned at different Y coordinates"
    when: "Objects are rendered in the scene"
    then: "Objects with higher Y values appear in front of objects with lower Y values"
  - id: "AC-002"
    description: "Camera following remains unaffected"
    given: "Player moves around the scene"
    when: "Player position changes"
    then: "Camera smoothly follows player without disruption or stuttering"
  - id: "AC-003"
    description: "Object spawning works with new container"
    given: "Terrain generation is triggered"
    when: "Objects are spawned via noise thresholds"
    then: "Objects appear in the new YSort layer instead of old ObjectContainer"
nonGoals:
  - "Modifying player hierarchy or position"
  - "Changing camera behavior or smoothing settings"
  - "Restructuring perlin terrain generation logic"
  - "Performance optimizations beyond YSort"
