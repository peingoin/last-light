    description: "Tile 3,2 spawns with same frequency as trees"
    given: "Terrain generation is performed"
    when: "Noise values match tree spawning thresholds"
    then: "Tile 3,2 appears with probability (0.65 / 1.75)"
  - id: "AC-002"
    description: "Tile 3,2 uses object noise like trees"
    given: "A position on the terrain"
    when: "Tile classification is performed"
    then: "Object noise is used for tile 3,2 probability calculation"
  - id: "AC-003"
    description: "Existing terrain types unchanged"
    given: "Areas where tile 3,2 doesn't spawn"
    when: "Terrain generation occurs"
    then: "Original tile types 1 and 2 continue to spawn normally"
nonGoals:
  - "Modifying tree spawning frequency or logic"
