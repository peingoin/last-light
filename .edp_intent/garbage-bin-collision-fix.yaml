originalIntent: "I made foraging feature where if you press e on the garbage bins, it gets 6-10 steel and wood combined, but it doesnt work rn. I assume its because the area2d is too small, and you need to make it 3x bigger."

    description: "Player can detect garbage bins for interaction"
    given: "Player is within 25 unit radius of garbage bin"
    when: "Player approaches garbage bin"
    then: "Interaction prompt appears (body_entered signal fires)"
  - id: "AC-002"
    description: "Player can interact with garbage bins using E key"
    given: "Player is near garbage bin and sees interaction prompt"
    when: "Player presses E key"
    then: "interact_with method is called and resources are collected"

    description: "Garbage bin becomes non-interactable after use"
    given: "Player has successfully interacted with garbage bin"
